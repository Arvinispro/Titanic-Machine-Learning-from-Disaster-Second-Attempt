# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Second-Attempt
Built a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival using Random Forest. Followed tutorials step by step to learn data preprocessing and model building, then trained and tuned the model myself, achieving 0.79186 accuracy on Kaggle.
